                Our Story
            </h2>
            <p>
                Aurora's lifelong fascination with LEGO sparked the creation of Brickwell. 
                She envisioned a space where imagination could flourish, and builders could 
                bring their ideas to life. Aurora isn't just our owner; she's also a builder at heart. 
                Her infectious love for LEGO inspires us all to see the world through the eyes of a creator.
